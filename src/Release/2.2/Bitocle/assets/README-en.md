## What is Bitocle?

Bitocle is a simple app that allows you to view your code on GitHub.

Version: 2.2 Release

For Android 4.0+.

## Some explains:

 - Bitocle use OAuth so you don't worry about your GitHub Password, we don't use/save it.

 - Bitocle is "Read Only", we don't change any thing on your GitHub.

 - Sorry for my poor English :)

## How to use it?

We call the first list you see "main list".

 - You can use "Search" to quick skip on main list.

 - Type "User/Repo" style on "Search", you can add the repo("User/Repo") to main list.

 - On "Star" interface, you can click the right button on a(n) item and "Add" means you can add this item to main list.

 - On catalog, long click, add bookmark.

 - On "Bookmark" interface, long click, remove bookmark.

 - Use the menu item "Highlight" of "Overflow" on ActionBar to select awesome source highlight effect.

 - Use the menu item "Horizontal" of "Overflow" on ActionBar, Bitocle will auto landscape when you view your code.

 - Use the menu item "Night" of "Overflow" on ActionBar for night.

 - The "back" button on the left of ActionBar will back to main list whenever/whereever.

 - The "back" button on the button of screen will back to the previous interface you ever seen; but when you click "Bookmark" menu, it will be reset.

## Does Bitocle has some matters?

 - We use `System.exit(0)` to quit, for killing some unknown threads. So it is not very grace.

 - No cache. I have no idea to make it come true.

 - The icon of Bitocle looks no very good, I hope someone could help us make a(n) awesome icon.

 - jQuery on WebView looks not very efficent.

 - When a line is too long, WebView will show whiht edge when you use some dark themes. We don't suggest you to write too long, see[google-styleguide](https://code.google.com/p/google-styleguide/ "google-styleguide").

 - When WebView load Markdown, the image may loaded failed, for network state or other reasons.

 - We suggest you use UTF-8 encoding for no messy code.

 - Failed to adapt some phone.

## What we will do next?

 - Try to fix some bugs.

 - Optimize Bitcole source code.

 - Optimize UI.
